# Social Media Counter Overview
The goal of this project is to create a display using RGB LED panels that shift through social media icons and their associated number of likes, subscribers, followers, and so forth. Inbetween social media counts will be animated transitions to add some variety and to fully untilize the potential of the LED panels artistically, the transitions randomized from the pool of available animations. Since the panels need a container, a case will be modeled and printed via 3D printer, designed to be modular for more or less panels depending on the projects needs while also being both wall mountable and portable. Eventually, the counts for each social media shown hopefully will be automatically updated, the number of likes, subscribers, followers, and so forth pulled automatically every so often using API Keys.
### Current Progress:
- [x] Social Media Icons & manual numbers run.
- [x] Randomized transitions between social media numbers run.
- [x] Case for social media counter printed and stable. 
- [ ] Automated Social Media numbers with API Keys run.
