#Social Media Counter Overview
The goal of this project is to create a display using RGB LED panels that shift through social media icons and their associated number of likes, subscribers, followers, and so forth. Inbetween social media counts will be animated transitions to add some variety and to fully untilize the potential of the LED panels artistically, the transitions randomized from the pool of available animations. Eventually, the counts for each social media shown hopefully will be automatically updated, the number of likes, subscribers, followers, and so forth pulled automatically every so often using API Keys.
###Current Progress:
- [x] Social Media Icons & manual numbers run.
- [x] Randomized transitions between social media numbers run.
- [ ] Automated Social Media numbers with API Keys run.
